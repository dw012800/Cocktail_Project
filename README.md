This app is a random cocktail recipe display. Pressing on the button will return a random cocktail recipe and aan image. In order to do this project I wireframed out a simple design. Starting off after building the html, I separated all the different parts in divs in order to make each section the format I wanted. On the app.js, I created a fetch request with window.onload in order to retrieve data before loading all of it to the responses. I used a promise in order to be able to display the data that came back from the cocktail API. Then accesed the object and used query selector to display all the parts in inner text. After that I put in a button with addEventListener "click" to have a module that can call on the fetch request.
